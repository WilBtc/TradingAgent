```

### Get Help:

## 🎯 **COMMON ISSUES**

### **"No API credentials"**
- Make sure you copied `.env.example` to `.env`
- Double-check your LNMarkets API keys
- Make sure `LNMARKETS_TESTNET=false` for live trading

### **"Permission denied"**
- Run `chmod +x Makefile`
- Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed

### **"No trades happening"**
- The AI is picky - it only trades when confident
- Check `make logs` to see what it's thinking
- Markets might be too volatile (AI waits for good setups)

### **"I want to customize settings"**
- Edit the `.env` file
- Restart with `make stop && make run`

## 💎 **PRO TIPS**

1. **Start with test mode** if you're nervous
2. **Let it run for at least 24 hours** before judging results
3. **Don't panic** if it's not trading immediately - the AI is patient
4. **Check the logs** to understand what it's doing
5. **Trust the process** - emotions are your enemy, AI is your friend
